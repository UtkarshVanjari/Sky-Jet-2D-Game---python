Sky Jet – 2D Jet Shooter Game 🎮

Author: Utkarsh Vanjari
Tech stack: Python + Pygame
GitHub: [Insert your repo link here]

🚀 Project Overview :-

“Sky Jet” is an immersive action-arcade style 2D jet shooter built using Pygame. Players pilot a jet through the skies, dodge incoming missiles and obstacles, fight for survival and chase high scores.
I designed this for fun and as a showcase of game-mechanics, UI flow and user experience, drawing on my passion for both coding and gaming.


🎯 Key Features :-

Moving blue-sky background with static stone-wall sides, creating a dynamic yet grounded environment.

Countdown screen at the start — retains the original blue-sky background image (no grey fill).

Main menu, instructions screen, pause/resume functionality.

Multiple levels of increasing difficulty.

Score tracking + heart-based lives system.

New: Two-player mode added — one player controlling jet A and the second controlling jet B (friendly competition or cooperation!).

Shop feature: Use your in-game score to unlock new jet skins and preview them in the shop menu.


🔧 Why I Built It :=

As part of my learning journey:

To deepen my hands-on experience in Python / Pygame game development.

To explore UI/UX flows in games (menus, levels, lives, scores).

Because the technical challenge of adding features like moving background + shop system + multiplayer mode excited me.

To share a fun, complete project in my portfolio (tieing into my broader interest in software, cloud and solution architecture).


🎮 How to Run :-

This is the fun part! 🎉
You can create your own 2D Sky Jet Game in just a few minutes — all you need is Python and Pygame.

Here’s how:

1. Create a Folder
Make a new folder named sky-jet.

2. Add Assets
Inside that folder, create another folder named assets.
Put all your PNGs inside this folder — for example:
background.png  
jet1.png  
jet1_alt.png  
jet2.png  
missile.png  
(You can also add your own sprites or rename them in the code.)

3. Create the Python File
Inside the sky-jet folder, make a file named main.py.

4. Copy the Game Code
Simply copy my Sky Jet game code and paste it inside main.py.
(I’ll include the full working code in this repository.)

5. Install Pygame
Open your terminal or VS Code terminal and type:-
pip install pygame

6. Run the Game
Now just type:
python main.py

7. Enjoy the Magic!
That’s it — your 2D Sky Jet Game is ready to fly!
Watch your jet soar through the skies, dodge missiles, and rack up that score 🪄



🛠 Future Improvements :-

Online multiplayer mode (networked two-player).

More enemy types (bosses, different missiles, aerial obstacles).

Power-ups (shield, double-shot, speed boost).

Leaderboard integration (cloud or local).

Mobile adaptation (touch controls).

Refactoring via a game-engine pattern (e.g., state-machine, scenes).


This project reflects my journey as a developer — from writing automation scripts to creating interactive Python games.
If you love Python, creativity, or simply want to see how far you can push your imagination, Sky Jet is a great starting point.

Clone it. Run it. Play it.
And watch your jet touch the sky. ☁️
